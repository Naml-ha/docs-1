description: Leverage the external API to programmatically trigger updates
---

<Note>
  The Mintlify REST API is only available on the [startup plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.

If you are looking to document your own API's, check out the
[API Documentation](/api-reference/api-playground) section.

</Note>

The primary use-case will be to trigger updates. We will be adding more and more
functionality to the API overtime. Let us know what else you want to see in
[our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/api). The API key is
associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.
